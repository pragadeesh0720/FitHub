    <p2>1.Stance width can vary with a sumo DL. Some prefer toes near the plates. Others prefer a more narrow stance to get more drive off the floor.</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>2.Make sure your arms are inside your legs. The bar should be just over your mid-foot. Flatten your back and push your heels into the floor.</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>3.Try to extend your knees and hips simultaneously.</p2>
